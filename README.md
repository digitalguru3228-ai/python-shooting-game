# 🚀 Python Space Shooter Game

A 2D space shooting game developed using **Python and Pygame** as part of a college mini project.  
The game demonstrates core concepts of game development such as event handling, collision detection, game states, levels, and sound integration.

---

## 📌 Introduction

The **Python Space Shooter Game** is a simple arcade-style shooting game where the player controls a spaceship and shoots incoming enemies.  
This project was developed for **learning purposes** to understand Python programming, game loops, modular design, and basic software engineering practices.

The project follows a clean structure and is documented using industry-standard GitHub practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To learn Python game development using the Pygame library
- To understand game loops, events, and rendering
- To implement collision detection and scoring logic
- To apply version control using GitHub
- To build a presentable and well-documented college project

---

## 🎮 Features

- Start screen with a **Start Game button**
- Player spaceship with movement and shooting controls
- Enemy spawning with increasing difficulty
- Level system based on score
- Sound effects for shooting and enemy hit
- Game Over screen with restart option
- Clean UI with background and sprite support
